Product Spec
1. User Stories (Required and Optional)
Required Must-have Stories
As an international student away from my family who loves to cook, I want to be able to easily browse and access a variety of family-friendly recipes on my phone, so I can plan meals ahead of time and make grocery shopping more efficient. I also want the ability to save my favorite recipes and share them with friends who have similar tastes. Additionally, having features like cooking timers and ingredient substitutions would be helpful when I'm in the kitchen with limited time and resources. Overall, I'm looking for an app that simplifies the meal planning process and inspires me to try new dishes while catering to my family's preferences and dietary needs."
